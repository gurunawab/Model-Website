# Model-Website
This project is a sleek, modern, and highly interactive landing page for GNCODE, an OpenAI-powered chat application.

🌟 Key Features & Design Highlights
Modern, Dark-Themed UI: The design features a compelling dark background (rgb(14 12 21)) with light gray and vibrant purple/blue accent colors, giving it a futuristic and premium feel.

Animated Gradient Elements: The "SIGN IN" button and the main hero image box use a dynamic, animated linear gradient background (animationGradient) with a unique clip-path polygon shape, creating a distinct visual style.

Parallax Effect: A subtle mouse-tracking parallax effect is applied to the .hero-icons-image element using JavaScript, adding depth and interactivity as the user moves their cursor.

Modal Sign-In Popup: The project includes a functional, animated sign-in modal that smoothly transitions in and out of the viewport using CSS @keyframes (openSigninAnimation and closeSigninAnimation), providing a great user experience.

Responsive Layout: The design is fully responsive across various devices (media queries for 1000px and 700px), ensuring a consistent and aesthetic layout on both desktop and mobile screens.

Clean Structure: The page is clearly structured with a fixed header, a central hero section for key messaging, and a list of company logos at the bottom for social proof.

💻 Technology Used
HTML5: For the page structure and semantic content.

CSS3: For styling, custom animations, and responsive design (media queries).

JavaScript (Vanilla JS): For handling user interactions, specifically the parallax mouse movement and controlling the Sign In modal's open/close functionality.

This project effectively showcases skills in creating visually striking, highly interactive, and responsive web interfaces.
